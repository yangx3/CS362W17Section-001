  The Non-Evo folder contains the files needed to recreate my Maven Project folder that does not use the 
  EvoSuite tests. Inside the Non-Evo folder is the pom.xml needed for a Maven Project that does not use EvoSuite.
  In the src folder inside the Non-Evo folder are two more folders, test/java/dominion and main/java/dominion. The test/java/dominion folder contains all of
  the unit tests, including RandomTestDominion.java, while the main/java/dominion folder contains all of the Dominion source
  code that they work with. 
  
  The EvoSuite folder simply contains all of the files necessary for the Maven project that uses EvoSuite using the exact same structure
  but with different files.
  
  
  In order to mutate the EvoSuite generated tests:
    Create a Maven Project for Dominion using the instructions from 9th Powerpoint (on Java Unit Testing Tools).
    
    Replace the pom.xml in your project with the pom.xml from the Evosuite folder, you may need to change 
    some of the pom.xml to have the correct name/groupId/ArtifactID etc for your project.
    
    Copy all of the files from the src/main/java/dominion folder inside the EvoSuite folder into the default package
    of the Dominion project.
    
    Copy all of the files from the src/test/java/dominion folder inside the Evosuite folder into the test\java folder
    of the Dominion project.
    
    You should now be able to use Command Prompt to navigate to the Project folder (the one with the pom.xml inside it)
    and type "mvn compile" and then "mvn test", or "mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage" .
    
  In order to mutate the manually written tests:
    Create a Maven Project for Dominion using the instructions from 9th Powerpoint (on Java Unit Testing Tools).
    
    Replace the pom.xml in your project with the pom.xml from the Non-Evo folder, you may need to change 
    some of the pom.xml to have the correct name/groupId/ArtifactID etc for your project.
    
    Copy all of the files from the src/main/java/dominion folder inside the EvoSuite folder into the default package
    of the Dominion project.
    
    Copy all of the files from the src/test/java/dominion folder inside the Evosuite folder into the test\java folder
    of the Dominion project.
    
    You should now be able to use Command Prompt to navigate to the Project folder (the one with the pom.xml inside it)
    and type "mvn compile" and then "mvn test", or "mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage" .
