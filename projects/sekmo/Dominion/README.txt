To compile with maven, go to directory CS362-SE2/projects/sekmo/Dominion/Assignment1 and run mvn compile. Then a .jar file should be created in the target folder. 

To run outside of Maven use the makefile. Then run PlayDominion

FOR ASSIGNMENT 2:

You may compile in the same manner as above, however redirect to CS362-SE2/projects/sekmo/Dominion/Assignment2
