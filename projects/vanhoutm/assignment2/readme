The Maven project is named MavenDominion and contains the appropriate files

Compiling
I was unable to figure out how to actually compile the maven project on Linux as NetBeans does this for me automatically. It should still work, but I was unable to install Maven on the server to test this due to lacking administrative privileges. 

The actual source code is located at ./MavenDominion/src/main/java/dominion
RandomTestDominion contains the main function

./EvoSuite_Tests contains the tests generated by the code coverage tool
./Code_Coverage contains the code coverage information


Running

Because of the lack of clarity of compiling I have made a jar so that the code can be run even if there is no clear way to compile 

This will run my test suite:

RandomDominion.jar must be in the directory. Java must be installed

$java -jar "RandomDominion.jar" 


There is no reason to run the automated tests from EvoSuite because 100% of them report errors. This is because it has I did not check for weird input values and assumed they would be within particular ranges. For this reason a method of calling those tests is not provided, but the tests themselves are. 

The HTML report was generated by the JaCoCoverage plugin on NetBeans and so cannot be replicated here
