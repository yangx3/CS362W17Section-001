Run morrilan\Dominion\target\Dominion-1.0.jar


The Jar works. The interface may not scale correctly, if that is a problem then email me at lvlegadrew@gmail.com, provide your computer resolution and I will post a branch just for you along with the link for it. 
If I have time, I get the resolution works correctly.

Run the jar from CS362W17Section-001\projects\morrilan\Dominion\target
It should be Dominion-1.0.jar, using 
$java -jar Dominion-1.0.jar 
while in the above directory.

f your resolution is low, it may smash the cards off the screen, did not get a chance to finish the screensize modifier... sorry about that.

It is broken. I have spent far more time troubleshooting broken software than I have spent programming.  It would have been done, but he came out and said, the day before it was due, that PITest doesn't count. Thanks for wasting my money, and my time. 
I have spent more time on this class than all of my other classes combined, just trying to get the provided software to work.  

There is a problem with Evosuite. It will be uncompileable. So all the test stuff are in the files before I used EvoSuite. 
One test fails, though it shouldn't test that system as it is never used in that way in my code. No way to stop it, no way to fix it. I have checked extensively.

There should be an html report made from Eclipse, also if you run a junit test on the Eclipse Directory, you will see the ai in progress. 
Keep in mind, the actual gui does not support 4 players, as our instructor only said to worry about 2 initally.  He changed his mind, which you can't do after developing a nearly full product.  Rediculous.  I am so disappointed with this instructor.  He keeps changing the requirements throughout the course and expects a lot more for being only 4 credits.

No other bugs I am aware of either, they prevent building.
