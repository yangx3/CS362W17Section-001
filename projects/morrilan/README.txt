Run Dominion.java

The Jar works. The interface may not scale correctly, if that is a problem then email me at lvlegadrew@gmail.com, provide your computer resolution and I will post a branch just for you along with the link for it. 
If I have time, I get the resolution works correctly.

Run the jar from CS362W17Section-001\projects\morrilan\Dominion\target
It should be Dominion-1.0.jar, using 
$java -jar Dominion-1.0.jar 
while in the above directory.
