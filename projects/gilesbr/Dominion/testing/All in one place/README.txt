to compile all >> make all

to compile all code and run >> make run

to compile and run test >> make test

to compile and run test with coverage >> make coverage

to clean build >> make clean

I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SEE THE COVERAGE REPORTS THROUGH TERMINAL
-if you do go ahead and take a look, and tell me how!
