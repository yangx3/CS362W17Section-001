Readme

I used Intellij IDEA instead of Eclipse because I have already been using it for other classes and am more familiar with it.
As far as I am aware it will still work the same on Eclipse.

Assignment2: 
Code coverage reports are in the Assignment2CoverageReport.zip file.
All the generated tests are in the src\evo folder.
The playthrough test is in the src\test\java folder. It just sets up the game and tells it to play, all of the AI is in the 
 functions within the Player.java and Gamestate.java
The test suite was difficult to set up and required adding a lot of stuff to my pom.xml file but because of all that it
 SHOULD be able to run all the tests without having to add anything else. It functions perfectly on my computer but I use
 intellij IDEA instead of eclipse.

Assignment1:
In order to run the code with test coverage I run the files in test\java which will execute all  the test cases.
Intellij has an option to automatically include the test coverage from maven+junit by clicking "Run tests with code coverage."
In my PDF I will go into detail on how the code covereage percents are displayed.
