Because all of the unit tests are written with Junit, they are not able to be run off of the server and must ran inside Eclipse with the Junit add-on.

Import all files in this folder as an eclipse package.  

To run the game:

You can use the run button on PlayDominion.java.


To run the tests:

The Junit tests are all in separate files but are all in a singular test suite called AllTests.java.
Navigate to the AllTests class and use run to run the tests, or use run with coverage to see the coverage of the tests.
