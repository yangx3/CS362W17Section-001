How to run code:

Running with Makefile:
Make file with appropriate java files can be found in:
Assignement01\Dominion\src\Dominion\src\main\java\org\cs362\dominion\Using Make File

-use "make compile" to compile code
-use "make execute" to run java application
-use "make clean" to clean up the *.class files that was generated by the compile

Running with Maven: 
My pom file is located in Assignement01\Dominion\src\Dominion
Once this is the current working directory you can compile the code with "mvn compile"
Then once the compile is done run "mvn package"
The package will make a .jar file under .\target.

To run this jar file use this line of code "java -cp target/Dominion-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.cs362.dominion.PlayGame" while still being under the directory with the pom file.

To run the unit suite, be in the pom file location and run "mvn test"
To run the code coverage, be in the pom file location and run "mvn cobertura:cobertura". A index.html should be generated under .\target\site\cobertura.


If Maven or Make cannot be used, the main code for the game can be found:
\Assignement01\Dominion\src\Dominion\src\main\java\org\cs362\dominion

The test code/suite can be found:
\Assignement01\Dominion\src\Dominion\src\test\java\org\cs362\dominion

Html Files can be found:
\Assignement01\Dominion\src\Dominion\target\site\cobertura

Use an IDE to run the main code, I used Intellij and imported the code into the environment.
