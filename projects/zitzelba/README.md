Hello This is the README Document for my assignment.
So, in theory the program should compile for both maven and normal use, just like any other.
to compile for MVN
Currently there is a glitch in the pom.xml file that me and the teacher have been working on fixing so currently it
doesn't run correctly on my computer. But others have told me that this is a local problem and it compiles fine
on other people's computers, so in theory this is how it should work.

"mvn compile" after putting the src into the correct place
"mvn package"

This should normally work to compile the code in maven

Outside of maven
src/main/java$ javac org/cs362/dominion/*.java

this should create a program that can be run.

src/main/java$ java org.cs362.dominion.PlayDominion

My code prints alot of stuff, but it has always run to the end.

Note that all tests are in the src/test directory and my cobertura reports are in imp2acobertura and imp2bcobertura. The tests generated by evosuite have been modified to run in maven with the given pom.xml and can be found in Imp2acobertura as well as in the src/test directory.

For the final project, all of my tests and reports can be found in the file "finalPITESTandTests". If you place the tests inside into the src/test directory, they will run. Reports were generated with PITEST.
