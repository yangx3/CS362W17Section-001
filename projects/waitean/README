I have no idea how I would compile this outside of the Maven structure.
I couldn't find a way to get the maven structure onto github (probably doesn't help that I know nothing about github).

How I normally compile is by putting these files into the respective main and test folders then using the command
mvn compile
then I used 
mvn package (Though I'm not sure what this does, I'm not familair with maven either)

Trying to actually get the program to run would be through a java command targeting all the way into the maven file structure. 
To get the code coverage I used 
mvn cobertura:cobertura

And just to run the tests was
mvn test

Seems fairly standard. Normally I would just run code inside of the Eclipse editor then package it into a jar file if
I needed to run the program outside of the editor. To get the files to compile into class files outside of the editor
I am fairly sure the command is javac *.java Then you should be able to run the game just by calling java PlayDominion.
I could not get the tests to compile without using maven.
