Project folder for Kailyn Hellwege for CS 362.

In the CodeCoverageReport directory, there are directories for the html reports for the code coverage from Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.

In the dominion directory, there is a directory that contains the maven src directory from assignment 1 and another directory that has a new maven source directory with the updated code for assignment 2 and the new tests generated by Randoop and my random tester.


Instructions for Running Dominion Game (In assignment 1 directory inside of dominion directory):

1. Go to directory with maven src folder 

2. Type "mvn package", which will run the unit tests with code coverage

3. You can play the game without the unit tests by typing "java -cp target/dominion-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar PlayGame". (Make sure this is after you have already done "mvn package")

4. You can make the code coverage report by typing "mvn jacoco:report". The HTML file will be in target\site\jacoco.


Instructions for running the unit tests generated by Randoop and the random tester (In assignment 2 directory inside of dominion directory):

1. Go to directory with maven src folder (dominion/Assignment2)

2. Type "mvn package". This will run both test files.

3. To get a code coverage report, type "mvn jacoco:report". The HTML file will be in target\site\jacoco.
