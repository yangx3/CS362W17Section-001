To compile:

mvn compile 

To run tests:

mvn test

To run cobertura:

mvn cobertura:cobertura

If mvn complains junit can not be found:

mvn dependency:list

Instructions:
For some odd reason I could not get my tests running on flip. The maven project still
compiles though so I'm turning it in as is. I've already run the tests on my local
windows machine, proof being in that I have the tests generated by evosuite. The
error that I seem to be running into on flip is that the tests are trying to access
the location of the JRE on my local machine. Anywas below is an explanation on how to
access the results of the tests and where to view the tests. I have also included
the line of instructions I used on my local machine to acchieve this.

Compilation instrauctions:
Evo suite tests generated through:

mvn -DmemoryInMB=2000 -Dcores=2 evosuite:generate evosuite:export test

Compilation (Post Evo Suite tests being generated):
mvn compile
mvn test 
mvn cobertura:cobertura

mvn package was used to generate a jar.
