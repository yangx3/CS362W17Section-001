"dominion without Maven" includes the base files to run my dominion and can be compiled with the following:
	javac Card.java is all thats needed to compile just replace Card with the other file names.
	I included a bash file "compileall" that will do the compiling.
	To run the code simply type the command:
	java dominion

"dominionMaven" is with Maven and dominion.java is where the main for my code is located. I hope this is all you need for maven.

My unit tests are in unitTests.java
