Say, fellas, did someone mention the door to darkness?

DIRECTIONS:

- This code was written and compiled in Intellij. While I do not believe it needs Intellij to be compiled or ran, if it does not
work then I would suggest using it with that IDE. I am unfamiliar with Java within terminal and Eclipse so I have not tested it
within those spaces (although Cobertura compiled). 

- As you may have noticed there are now two folders, one has the evosuite tests and the other has the randomplayer tests. This was due to the fact the evosuite sucked hardcore and threw nonsensical errors. Because of this I there was no way I could debug my good test suites that I had written. So the regular dominion file has the original pom.xml and the new random player test to ensure that nothing was going wrong with the pom.xml (although I did test it with the evosuite pom.xml and it also worked). 

TO RUN:
- Just open the diretory that contains all the tests to run the tests. There will be 5 Assertion failures for the 5 bugs that were needed for this assignment. They not cause the program to crash. 

- The evosuite has many errors, but these are errors with the test suite itself and not the code. see the HW2 submission for more informaiton.
