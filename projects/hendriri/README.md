Say, fellas, did someone mention the door to darkness?

DIRECTIONS:

- This code was written and compiled in Intellij. While I do not believe it needs Intellij to be compiled or ran, if it does not
work then I would suggest using it with that IDE. I am unfamiliar with Java within terminal and Eclipse so I have not tested it
within those spaces (although Cobertura compiled). 

TO RUN:
- Just the diretory that contains all the tests to run the tests. There will be 5 Assertion failures for the 5 bugs that were needed for this assignment. They not cause the program to crash.
